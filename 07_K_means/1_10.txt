While calculating the accuracy and the confusion matrix, we find something around 
those values :


Accuracy:
84.66666666666667

Confusion matrix:
 [[50  0  0 ...  0  0  0]
 [ 0 37 10 ...  0  0  0]
 [ 0 13 40 ...  0  0  0]
 ...
 [ 0  0  0 ...  0  0  0]


The accuracy is usually between 80% and 85%.
